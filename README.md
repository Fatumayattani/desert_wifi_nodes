# Deslink

A decentralized, community-owned WiFi network platform powered by solar energy and Scroll blockchain payments. This project aims to bridge the digital gap by providing affordable, reliable internet access to underserved communities.


## Overview

Deslink is a web application that enables communities to establish and manage their own solar-powered WiFi mesh networks. Users can browse available WiFi nodes in a centralized hub, make payments via cryptocurrency on the Scroll network, and track their usage through an intuitive dashboard. All payments are routed to a central node (#1) for simplified network management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask browser extension
- ETH on Scroll Sepolia testnet ([Get testnet ETH](https://sepolia.scroll.io/faucet))
- Supabase account (free tier available)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fatumayattani/deslink.git
cd deslink
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new Supabase project
   - Run the migration in `supabase/migrations/`
   - Copy your Supabase URL and anon key

4. Configure environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

5. Deploy the Smart Contract:
   - Follow instructions in [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)
   - Deploy `contracts/DesertWifiNodesV2.sol` to Scroll Sepolia
   - Update contract address in `src/contracts/desertWifiNodesV2Config.ts`

6. Ensure Node #1 exists:
   - Register at least one node with nodeId = 1 on the blockchain
   - All payments will be routed to this node

7. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

8. Open browser at `http://localhost:5173`

9. Connect MetaMask:
   - Switch to Scroll Sepolia network
   - Click "Connect Wallet"
   - Approve the connection

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Production files will be in the `dist/` directory.

### Development Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Payment Methods

### ETH Payments
- Native Scroll network currency
- Single-step transaction
- Instant confirmation
- Gas fees included

### USDC/USDT Payments
- Stablecoin payments for price stability
- Two-step process:
  1. Approve token spending
  2. Complete payment transaction
- USD-denominated pricing
- Lower volatility

## Node Search & Filtering

Users can find the perfect node using:

### Search
- Search by location name
- Real-time search updates

### Filters
- **Active Only**: Show only operational nodes
- **Minimum Reputation**: Filter by quality score (50+, 70+, 85+)
