# Deslink V2 - Enhanced Features

## Overview

Version 2 of the Deslink smart contract adds powerful features for a more robust, community-driven WiFi network platform.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Multi-Currency Payment Support üí∞

Accept payments in three currencies:
- **ETH** - Native Ethereum on Scroll
- **USDC** - USD Coin stablecoin
- **USDT** - Tether stablecoin

**Benefits:**
- Reduced volatility risk for node operators
- More accessible for users preferring stable currencies
- Broader payment options increase adoption

### 2. Automatic Payment Splitting üìä

Every payment is automatically split between:
- **90%** to node operator (configurable)
- **10%** to treasury (configurable via governance)

**Benefits:**
- Sustainable funding for network development
- Transparent fee structure
- Democratic control through governance

### 3. Reputation System ‚≠ê

Track reputation for both users and nodes:

**Users earn reputation by:**
- Using the network (+1 per payment)
- Rating nodes (+2 per rating)
- First-time use bonus (+10)

**Nodes earn reputation through:**
- Positive ratings from users (+5 per upvote)
- Maintaining quality service
- Total connections served

**Benefits:**
- Quality assurance for the network
- Incentivizes good behavior
- Unlocks governance participation

### 4. Governance & DAO Features üó≥Ô∏è

Community-driven decision making through proposals and voting.

**Proposal Types:**
1. **Update Treasury Fee** - Adjust fee percentage (0-50% max)
2. **Remove Node** - Remove malicious or inactive nodes
3. **Update Min Reputation** - Change governance eligibility threshold
4. **Treasury Withdrawal** - Authorize treasury fund releases

**Participation Requirements:**
- 100+ reputation score (adjustable)
- OR designated governance member status

**Proposal Lifecycle:**
1. Create proposal (requires governance eligibility)
2. Community votes (7-day window)
3. Execute if approved (votes for > votes against)

**Benefits:**
- Democratic network governance
- Protection against bad actors
- Transparent decision-making
- Community ownership

### 5. Enhanced Node Features üì°

Nodes now track:
- **Upvotes/Downvotes** - User satisfaction metrics
- **Total Connections** - Usage statistics
- **Reputation Score** - Quality indicator
- **Multi-currency earnings** - Separate ETH, USDC, USDT balances

### 6. Node Rating System ‚öñÔ∏è

Users can rate nodes after using them:
- **Upvote** - Good experience (+5 reputation to node, +10 to owner)
- **Downvote** - Poor experience (-5 reputation to node, -5 to owner)

**Benefits:**
- Self-regulating quality
- Incentivizes excellent service
- Helps users choose reliable nodes

## Technical Improvements

### Smart Contract Architecture

- Optimized data structures

## Comparison: V1 vs V2

| Feature | V1 | V2 |
|---------|----|----|
| Payment Methods | ETH only | ETH, USDC, USDT |
| Fee Structure | All to node owner | 90% node, 10% treasury |
| Reputation System | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Governance | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Proposals & Voting |
| Node Ratings | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ Upvote/Downvote |
| Treasury Management | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Multi-currency Earnings | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |
| Community Control | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ |

## Use Cases

### For Users
- Pay with preferred currency (ETH or stablecoins)
- Rate node quality after use
- Build reputation through network usage
- Participate in governance decisions
- Transparent fee structure

### For Node Operators
- Reduce currency volatility risk with stablecoins
- Accept multiple payment methods
- Build reputation for higher visibility
- Withdraw earnings in multiple currencies
- Democratic input on network policies

### For the Network
- Sustainable development funding via treasury
- Self-regulating quality through ratings
- Community-driven governance
- Democratic fee adjustments
- Protection against bad actors

## Migration from V1 to V2

### Smart Contract
1. Deploy V2 contract with treasury and token addresses
2. Update frontend environment variables
3. Switch Web3 context to V2
4. Test thoroughly on testnet

### Frontend Changes
- New payment modal with currency selection
- Governance panel for proposals and voting
- Reputation display in user dashboard
- Multi-currency balance tracking

### Data Migration
- V1 and V2 are separate contracts
- No automatic data migration
- Users keep their reputation fresh start
- Nodes must re-register in V2

## Getting Started with V2

1. **Deploy Contracts**
   - Deploy test ERC20 tokens (testnet) or use official USDC/USDT (mainnet)
   - Deploy DesertWifiNodesV2 with treasury and token addresses
   - Save contract address

2. **Configure Frontend**
   ```env
   VITE_CONTRACT_V2_ADDRESS=0xYourV2Address
   VITE_USDC_ADDRESS=0xUSDCAddress
   VITE_USDT_ADDRESS=0xUSDTAddress
   ```

3. **Update Code**
   - Use `Web3ProviderV2` in main.tsx
   - Import `useWeb3V2` in components
   - Use `PaymentModalV2` for payments

4. **Test Features**
   - Make payments in all currencies
   - Rate nodes
   - Build reputation to 100+
   - Create and vote on proposals

## Roadmap

Future enhancements could include:
- Subscription-based payments
- Staking for node operators
- Governance token (separate ERC20)
- NFT-based node ownership
- Layer 3 integration
- Cross-chain bridging
- Mobile app integration

## Support & Resources

- **Deployment Guide**: See DEPLOYMENT.md
- **Smart Contract**: contracts/DesertWifiNodesV2.sol
- **Frontend Integration**: src/contexts/Web3ContextV2.tsx
- **Components**: GovernancePanel.tsx, PaymentModalV2.tsx

## Security Audit Recommendations

Before mainnet deployment, consider auditing:
- Payment splitting logic
- Governance proposal execution
- Treasury withdrawal mechanisms
- Reputation calculation
- ERC20 token interactions
- Access control patterns
